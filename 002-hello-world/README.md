## Debugging React based apps

It's not actually possible to debug (e.g. create breakpoints) react in webstorm. That's because the actual execution of code occurs on the browser side (chrome). 

However you can debug the app via chrome:

1. Run `npm start`, then open the app on chrome. 
2. Open the app in chrome, e.g. - http://localhost:3000/
3. Open the chrome developer tools
4. Go to the sources tab, and you can add breakpoints their. 
5. Also all `console.log(...)` will appear in the consoles tab.
