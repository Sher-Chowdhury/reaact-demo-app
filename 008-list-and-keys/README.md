### my-app1 
We use the array's `map()` method, to generate a new array from the existing array, where each item contains jsx code. This jsx code contains a list. 


### my-app2
my-app1 showed how to constrcut a html list, using `<ul>` and `<li>` tags.



This shows how to use map to construct rows in a html-table, using table tags, e.g. `<td>` tags, `<tr>` tags...etc.

same as my-app2 but written in a slightly refactored to demonstrate the destructuring of props, and also component broken down in 2 components.

### my-app4
Same as my-app3, but refactored even more. This shows even more extreme form of destructuring of props.
