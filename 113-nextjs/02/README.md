# my-app1

This is a hello-world nextjs app. 

Notice, unlike ordinary react, there is no index.html


```bash
npm init -y
npm install react react-dom next
```

You also need to create a folder called `pages` and put the index.js inside it. 

```
npm run dev
```

Notice, unlike ordinary react, in nextjs we don't have a `public` folder containing a `index.html` file contains a root div tag. 

That gets generated by nextjs behind the scenes, from the `index.js` file, as part of server-side-rendering.

So to create faq.html, or about.html. we need to have the corresponding `faq.js` and `about.js` files and put them in the `pages` folder. 

Hence, compared to standard [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#recommended-toolchains), which is limited
to creating a "single-page application", where that page gives the impression 
that it's a "multi-page application", next.js offers a proper multi-page application.
